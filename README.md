FEC project [Mode all layered RC vehicle]
Autonomous Obstacle-Avoiding Robot with Fog, Edge, and Cloud Computing
Introduction
This repository contains the code and documentation for an autonomous obstacle-avoiding robot project. The project integrates fog, edge, and cloud computing principles to navigate obstacles autonomously while optimizing traffic flow and safety.

Features
Object following mode: The robot autonomously follows objects within a specified distance.
Sudden brake application: The robot can apply sudden brakes to avoid collisions.
Obstacle avoidance: Utilizes sensors to navigate around obstacles in its path.
Police mode: Simulates traffic control by enforcing speed limits and controlling vehicle movements.
Hardware Requirements
Arduino Uno
Motor shield
Infrared sensors
Ultrasonic sensors
Bluetooth module (optional)
WiFi module (optional)
Software Requirements
Arduino IDE
React JS for data visualization
Python libraries (numpy, matplotlib) for local data analysis
Getting Started
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the required software and libraries mentioned above.
Connect the hardware components as per the provided schematic.
Upload the Arduino code to the Arduino Uno.
Run the React app for data visualization.
Usage
Power on the robot and set the desired mode (object following, police mode, etc.).
Monitor the robot's behavior using the data visualization interface.
Experiment with different scenarios to test the robot's performance.
